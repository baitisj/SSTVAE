"""The overlay document: what to draw on top of a picture.

Two design choices here exist to make *templates* -- saving an overlay
and reapplying it to tomorrow's picture -- a later UI-only change rather
than a redesign:

**Coordinates are normalized** to 0..1 of the canvas, and sizes are
fractions of it. A document is therefore resolution-independent, so the
same one frames correctly whatever the base image was, and the editor
can be any size on screen without baking its pixel geometry in.

**Image insets are late-bound references, not pasted bitmaps.**
`ImageItem.source` is `"last_rx"` or a file path, resolved at render
time. A saved template that says "inset the most recent received image,
bottom left" therefore keeps meaning that next week -- which is the
whole point of a template, and would be impossible if the editor
flattened the bitmap in at composition time.

Nothing in this module (or in render.py) imports Qt, so the document and
its rendering stay testable and reusable from the command line.
