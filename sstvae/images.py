"""Framing pictures for the codec, and finding a font to draw on them.

Split out of `data.py` so the receive and transmit paths don't have to
import the training dataset machinery. `data.py` pulls in torchvision
and `torch.utils.data` to build its augmentation pipeline; everything
here is PIL plus a single array conversion, and a station that only
sends and receives pictures has no use for the rest.

`data.py` imports from this module, so training keeps working unchanged
and there is one definition of the target geometry rather than two.

**This module must import without torch.** The codec runs on ONNX now
(`docs/onnx.md`), so the send path is numpy end to end; an unconditional
`import torch` here would drag 336 MB back into every station that only
wants to send a picture. The `*_tensor` functions still exist for
training and import torch lazily -- use `image_to_array` / `load_image`
everywhere else.
