"""Leave-one-out EM over a picture's passes, and the known-waveform
(template) search (design 8.3, spec 7 "Data-aided tracking with
leave-one-out references"; WP9).

Not a format module: nothing here goes on the air.

**EM.** Once a picture is partly received its own latents are a known
reference for tracking. For each member pass i of an accumulator, in
turn:

1. the leave-one-out accumulator (every member but i, plus what was
   merged from other receivers) gives the LMMSE latent
   a = (S'/W') W'/(1 + W') = S'/(1 + W') and its residual variance
   1/(1 + W'), in pass i's air order (`em_prior`);
2. that reference is re-modulated exactly as pass i was sent -- scrambled
   with pass i's q, precoded, phase-modulated with the e^{-v/2} factor of
   the mean waveform -- by giving the tracker x_hat = precode(a, q) and
   v = the block mean of 1/(1 + W') as soft data symbols (design 6.5);
3. pass i is re-tracked (timing refit included) and re-demodulated from
   its stored 250 Hz capture, and its (z, w) replace the old ones, which
   rebuilds the accumulator (`Store.update_pass`).

Step 3 reads each precoder block from a track whose templates leave that
block's parity of blocks out (`rereceive(split=True)`, the default; a
deviation from the design's single re-track): with the whole reference
in the templates, the reference's errors steer the gain and phase pass i
is read with at those same latents, the passes' errors correlate, and
the accumulator loses while every pass's own W rises.

What the reference buys, measured: little. Where tracking costs (a
disturbed SHORT pass at -24 dB beside a +8 dB reference) +0.1 to +0.3 dB
per pass on average against the same re-receive without it, -0.4 to
+0.7 dB seed to seed; on a quiet path, where the receiver tracks at the
genie, nothing measurable. The block split is
why: a precoder block spans about 2 s, and on a fast-fading path the
templates of the neighbouring blocks are already outside the channel's
coherence.

Rounds repeat until the accumulator's mean W gains less than `tol_db`.
The reference never contains pass i, so a pass of noise cannot confirm
itself: its template is independent of its own samples (P5).

What the re-receive knows beyond the pass's own first reception: the
accumulator's key fixes the header of every member (callsign, picture
ID, mode and codec ID from the key and the members' decoded headers, the
segment from membership), so the 2,474 header symbols are re-tracked as
known symbols even on a pass whose own header never decoded; and the
callsign windows' keying is known once any member's windows matched
(Z > 6). That is spec 8's "re-modulate exactly as pass i was sent".

**Template search** (spec 7 step 3, retroactive detection). A capture of
a slot that held no detectable pass is correlated with the expected
waveform E[s(t)] of the picture -- carrier, preamble, references, the
known header and the accumulator's soft data, with that slot's
scrambler -- over a grid of frequency, timing and clock hypotheses. The
statistic is A2's: 2 s chunks, coherent within a chunk and summed in
power over the frame,

    Lambda = sum_k |sum_n r[n + l] conj(e_k[n]) e^{-j 2 pi df n/fs}|^2 / (N0 E_k),

which is Gamma(K, 1) on noise for each cell (K chunks). The smallest
p-value is Bonferroni-corrected over every cell searched and turned into
a normal Z; a detection needs Z > 6, the receiver's single gate. The
carrier is the larger part of the template, so a pass of a *different*
picture from the same station is found too: the search finds passes,
and association (latent correlation) decides whose they are.
