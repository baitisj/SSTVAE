"""The live QRSSTVAE listener: audio in, a tile per signal out (spec 9, build step 6).

Not a format module. `qrss_listen.py` is its command line, and the
desktop app's QRSS window is one of its front ends: the app pipes its
capture audio in and shows the tiles this writes.

    8 kHz audio chunks --StreamFE--> FE 4 kHz --> FeRing (in memory, ~33 min)
                                              \\-> PassbandStore (48 h, optional)
    every refresh_s, for each slot whose frame is on the air:
        slot_capture: the slot's FE so far, blanked and normalised, the
                      rest (future, and any holes) noise, erased
        detect on the preamble (until detect_until_s), then
        receive_pass, round A only, with the unheard spans erased
        --> tile: header, SNR, share received, picture so far
    when a slot's frame has ended:
        receive_slot over the whole slot (round B, whole-slot search),
        associate into the multi-pass store, render the accumulator
        --> the tile goes "complete"

The tiles are a directory: `state.json` (rewritten atomically after
every change) and `tiles/<id>.png`. Anything can show them; nothing in
here knows about a GUI.

**The picture so far.** A pass in progress is received like a finished
one with every symbol not yet heard erased (`receive_pass(erase_s=)`),
so its W is honest about what arrived, and the tile is the store's
accumulator for that picture (earlier passes) plus this pass. Latents
are interleaved over the whole frame, so the whole picture sharpens at
once. v5 was not trained for a fraction of a group: a recognizable
picture a fifth of the way through is luck (spec 11, 12).

**Clock.** Audio has no timestamps here: a chunk is stamped when it is
read, its last sample at "now". Samples are numbered on the absolute
8 kHz grid round(t * 8000), so FE sample n is unix time n / 4000 (the
passband store's convention). Small differences between the sound
card's clock and the computer's are absorbed; when the two disagree by
more than RESYNC_S the other way -- samples arriving later than their
count says, which is audio that was never sent (the app stopped feeding
while it transmitted, or a capture stalled) -- the stream restarts at
the new time and the missing stretch stays a hole, erased in every pass
it touches. Samples arriving early (a burst after a stall) are only
believed after EARLY_WINDOW_S of nothing but: a pipe loses nothing, so
early audio is the sound card's clock running fast, which is slow. A
replayed file (`WavSource`) is stamped from its start time instead, so a
recording can be replayed faster than real time.
