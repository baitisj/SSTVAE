"""The single-pass receiver: `receive_pass`, `receive_slot`, `receive_wav`

              --round B (header decoded): header and keying known, re-track,
                re-extract--> PassResult

Round A tracks on the preamble, references, spare, lead-in, the plain
units of the callsign windows and the carrier under the unknown data.
Round B, after a CRC-valid header, adds the 2,474 header symbols as
known, and the callsign windows' Morse units when the keying matches the
header's callsign (Z > 6); both rounds' timing comes from the known
symbols' likelihood given the gain track. `receive_slot` runs the
acquisition over a stored slot, passes every candidate through gate V,
merges detections within 5 Hz, drops symbol-rate aliases and ghosts of
a stronger one, and receives each.

**Ghosts.** A strong CE signal passes gate V a second time about 12 Hz
either side of its carrier, at nearly its own timing: the reference
symbols recur every 16 positions (callsign windows are 24 x 16), so a
frequency error of k/(16 T) = 2.06 k Hz turns every reference by the
same phase and their correlation stays coherent; measured, k = 6
(12.4 Hz), with tau0 within 1.6 T of the true one and Z_ref up to 0.54
of the real pass's (FULL, -12 dB). A detection within GHOST_HZ of a
stronger one and within GHOST_T symbols of its timing is therefore taken
to be that transmission, before and again after tracking. The price is
a second station that is both under 20 Hz from a stronger one (the CE
plan spaces stations 50 Hz apart, and at 20 Hz their spectra overlap
anyway) and slot-aligned to within 3 symbols: it is not received.

A second kind got past that rule (integration review, 2026-10-09): 2 of
15 FULL passes at about -11 dB also returned a pass 8-14 Hz away with
its timing 6-10 symbols off, Z_ref 6.1-6.4 (at the gate, against 104
and 125 for the real pass), kappa at its 2.0 cap and flagged SUSPECT,
with an all-zero callsign read. After tracking, a SUSPECT pass within
GHOST_HZ of a sound pass and under GHOST_Z_RATIO of its Z_ref is
dropped too: whatever it is, its data are not usable, and a genuine
second station that close is already given up above.

Everything time-like comes from the `FrameSpec`: nothing here assumes a
slot length.
