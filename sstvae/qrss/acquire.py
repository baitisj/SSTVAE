"""Acquisition (design 6.3, WP5): A1 carrier lines, A2 preamble search,
A3 whole-slot track-before-detect, and their false-alarm constants.

Not a format module. Every detector here reports a statistic whose
distribution on noise is known -- Gamma for A1 and A2 by construction,
a Gumbel fitted by measurement for A3 -- because the single acceptance
decision is made later, by the verification gate V (`track.verify`,
Z_ref > 6) that every candidate from here goes through. These
detectors only have to keep the candidate list short without losing a
real signal.

Inputs are the blanked, normalised front end FE' (`frontend.blank`,
`frontend.normalise`): complex at FE_FS = 4000 Hz with 0 Hz at 1500 Hz
audio, and t0_index, the FE sample index of the nominal t0 (QH + 1 s)
on the receiver's clock. Frequencies are reported in audio Hz; times
in seconds after t0.

**A1. Carrier lines.** 4 s Hann frames (0.25 Hz bins) at a 2 s hop over
[t0 - 2.5 s, t0 + 22.5 s], each normalised by its median over the
300-2700 Hz bins and then each bin by the local spectral shape (the
median over frames, then over +-40 Hz: `cfar_normalise`), so a noise bin
is Exp(1) however the receiver's passband tilts; summed noncoherently along
linear drift lines of +-3 Hz/min in 0.5 Hz/min steps: a sum of M frames
is Gamma on noise -- Gamma(M), widened slightly for the 50% frame
overlap (`a1_gamma`) -- thresholded at a 1e-4 false-alarm rate per cell.
The whole FE band is searched, which covers +-400 Hz of an uncalibrated
Si5351 about any carrier the sender chose. Every local maximum at least
10 Hz from a stronger one is reported, up to 16: a weak signal beside a
strong one is A2's to judge, not A1's.

**A2. Preamble search** at each A1 candidate: channelise (drift taken
out), notch the carrier (y - LP(y), LP zero-phase +-0.6 Hz: this also
removes any lead-in), matched-filter with the CE pulse, and correlate
with the preamble in ten 66-symbol (2 s) chunks with zero-mean
templates, over tau0 in +-2.5 s and df in +-0.5 Hz. The statistic

    Lambda = sum_c |sum_s (a_s - mean_c a) m(tau0 + s T) e^{-j 2 pi df t_s}|^2
             / (sigma^2 sum_s (a_s - mean_c a)^2)

is Gamma(10, 1) per cell on noise. The chunk templates share one phase
reference, so runs of 2, 5 and 10 chunk sums also add coherently
(`preamble_scales`): 4, 10 and 20 s chunks, Gamma(5), Gamma(2) and
Gamma(1) on noise. A cell passes when its best scale's p, times the four
scales tested, is under 1e-7. The 2 s chunks alone (the design's A2)
detect ~75% of preambles at -28 dB; with the longer runs ~97%, while a
path that wanders still has the 2 s statistic, at 1.2 dB of threshold.
sigma^2 is per chunk: the MF output's median power, raised to the local
mean power over 6 s where that is higher, so the transient a switching
carrier leaves behind the notch (a lead-in ending) reads as noise. The
peak is then refined: df (and a residual drift, when significant) from
a line through the chunk phases, coherent over 20 s, then timing on the
coherent correlation of the whole preamble at fractional offsets (the
MF output is band-limited, so a cubic spline through it is exact). At
-25 dB that timing reaches the Cramer-Rao bound, about T/20 rms.

**Symbol-rate aliases.** A CE signal correlates with the preamble at
f +- k/T as well (the symbol rotation is then whole turns), down only by
the matched filter's response there, so a strong signal passes A2 at
+-33 Hz too. `acquire` drops a hit at a stronger hit's f +- k/T (k = 1, 2,
within 0.5 Hz) with the same timing (within T/2) and a Lambda 3x
smaller.

**Lead-in** (spec 2.8): A1 and A2 never use it (A2 by the notch and
the zero-mean templates); A3 sums it with the rest; `lead_in_span`
measures it for the tracker, 1 s windows of the notch-free MF output
walking back from the keying start, Z > 4 per window.

**A3. Track-before-detect** over the whole stored slot: the same 4 s/2 s
spectrogram from t0 - 10 s (a lead-in adds to it), cut into channels of
+-40 Hz at each A1 candidate and every 50 Hz across the band; a Viterbi
path per channel with |dbin| <= 2 per hop (15 Hz/min), transition cost
0.5 |dbin| (the noise emission's sd is 1) and emission = normalised
power - 1, normalised as A1's (`cfar_normalise`, local spectral shape
included: with a band-wide CFAR alone, a 1 dB passband tilt put 13 of
FULL's 47 channels past p < 1e-3 on noise). Z = sum of emissions / sqrt(n_frames). Z on noise grows like
sqrt(n_frames), so its Gumbel (`TBD_GUMBEL_*`) is tabulated against
n_frames, measured on noise-only captures (`tests/test_qrss_acquire.py`,
A-7) and interpolated in sqrt(n_frames): the slot length is a
`FrameSpec` property and may still change. Candidates pass at p < 1e-3.

The spectrogram is computed once on FE and the channels are bin ranges
of it, which gives the same 0.25 Hz bins as channelising first at a
fraction of the cost.

**Timing convention.** A detection's `Timing.tau0` is in CH samples
(1/250 s) counted from the nominal t0 on the receiver's clock: the
preamble's first symbol was received tau0/250 s after nominal t0.
