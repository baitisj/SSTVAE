"""Acquisition frequency range, and the optional carrier-drift loop.

Three changes landed together (2026-08-11, measured in docs/todo.md) and
each has a distinct way of going quietly wrong:

* the preamble search got wider, and the thing to protect is that it
  cost nothing -- a wider search that quietly changed the answer for
  an on-frequency station would be a regression dressed as a feature;
* the blind search got a much coarser CFO grid, which is only safe
  because the sub-bin peak is interpolated. Drop `refine_cfo` and every
  existing test still passes while the receiver hands the demodulator
  several Hz of error;
* drift tracking is off by default, and "off" has to mean *nothing
  happens*, not "a loop runs with small gains".
