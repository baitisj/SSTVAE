"""Timing must lock to the *first* path, not the strongest one.

Both acquisition paths find timing by taking the argmax of a correlation
against a known reference. On a two-path channel that is the strongest
path, which is not the first one, and which of the two is stronger
changes as the channel fades -- so the argmax lands `delay` samples late
whenever the echo wins, putting the early path's energy ahead of the
demodulation window where the cyclic prefix cannot cover it. On the
blind path, which re-acquires every poll, that showed up as a live
picture alternating between a clean decode and a mushy one for as long
as the reception lasted. See config.FIRST_PATH_SEARCH.

The channel here is a *deterministic* two-path echo rather than a
Watterson preset: the effect is a property of the geometry, and fading
would only add an RNG that decides how often the test exercises it.

Every test that asserts on the first path also asserts that the argmax
is somewhere else, because otherwise it would pass just as happily with
first-path selection deleted -- on a single-path channel the two are the
same answer by construction (that is what test_single_path_is_untouched
pins down).
