#
# Staging is step 2 of the packaging work: an archive somebody can unpack
# and *run*, which is what makes on-air testing possible before any
# installer or signing exists. `tools/make_installer.sh` then turns this
# tree into the platform's own container -- a .dmg, an AppImage, a setup
# .exe -- so the two halves stay separable: a developer can stage and run
# without any installer tooling present at all.
#
# One script rather than three CI blocks, because bash is present on all
# three runners and because a packaging step that can only be exercised
# by pushing is one that gets debugged six minutes at a time.
#
# **Not CPack**, which was the plan and is worth saying why it was not
# done. CPack packages what `install()` rules install, so adopting it
# means teaching CMake to install Qt -- which on two of three platforms
# means capturing the output of windeployqt/macdeployqt in install rules
# and on the third means reimplementing them. That is a rewrite of the
# part that already works, to gain generator plumbing for containers that
# are three lines of hdiutil, appimagetool and makensis respectively. The
# one thing CPack would genuinely buy is component installs, which this
# application does not have.
#
# What has to end up beside the executable, and why each is easy to
# forget:
#
#   Qt                 the deploy tools handle it on Windows and macOS;
#                      on Linux there is no such tool in the box, so the
#                      libraries and the platform plugins are copied by
#                      hand and found through a wrapper script.
#   libhamlib          pinned and bundled by us, so it is never on the
#                      target machine.
#   onnxruntime        likewise.
#
# The model artifacts are *not* bundled: they are fetched on first run
# and cached (see docs/onnx.md), which is what keeps this download small
# and lets a receive-only station skip the encoder entirely.
