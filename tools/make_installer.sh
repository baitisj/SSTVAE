#
# Step 3 of the packaging work, and deliberately a *second* script rather
# than more of package_app.sh. The split is the useful part: staging needs
# nothing but a compiler and Qt, so a developer can build, stage and run
# the result with none of the tooling below installed. Only the person
# producing a download needs hdiutil, appimagetool or makensis.
#
# What each platform gets, and why that one:
#
#   macOS     .dmg. The expected shape: a disk image with the bundle and
#             a symlink to /Applications, so installing is a drag. A .pkg
#             would be an installer for an application that has nothing
#             to install beyond copying itself.
#   Linux     AppImage. The one format that runs on distributions we have
#             not heard of, which matters because the Qt this bundles is
#             newer than several current distributions ship. A .deb and an
#             .rpm would each cover one family and need a build per
#             release; a Flatpak needs a runtime we would not control.
#   Windows   NSIS setup .exe. Start Menu entry, an uninstaller and the
#             "Apps & features" registration -- the three things a zip
#             cannot give. The zip is still published beside it, because
#             the installer needs administrator rights and a portable
#             copy on a stick does not.
#
# Nothing here signs anything -- that is `tools/sign.sh`, deliberately
# still a separate script and not a flag on this one. It runs twice on
# macOS and Windows: once over the staged tree before this script packs
# it, and once over what this script produced, because notarization has
# to see the *finished* container and the ticket is stapled back into it.
# Keeping the split means an unsigned installer is still one command,
# which is what a developer wants and what a fork's CI run gets.
