// The transmit pane's control strip, which must not change height.
//
// **This is the guard for a bug that broke the other pane.** The
// "Selected item" row used to hide itself when nothing was selected,
// while the comment where it is built said the opposite in bold. Two
// things followed, and the second is why this file exists:
//
//   1. The row is ~90 px, so the canvas jumped under the pointer on
//      every select and deselect -- on a composing surface, where the
//      thing being clicked is the thing that moves.
//
//   2. `PaneContainer::equalise_strips` -- the entire mechanism that
//      makes the received image and the composed image the same size --
//      runs only from `set_control_strips` and from a resize. Nothing
//      re-runs it when a strip's *content* changes height. So from the
//      first click on the canvas, both strips held minimums computed
//      for a layout that no longer existed and the two images silently
//      stopped matching, until something happened to resize the window.
//
// `test_pane_container.cpp` cannot catch this: it drives the container
// with stand-in panes whose strips are static, which is right for what
// it tests and blind to what this tests. The check has to be on the
// real panel.
//
// Deliberately a height *invariant* rather than a "the box is visible"
// assertion: what the layout cares about is the number, and hiding the
// row by some other means later would break the panes the same way.
