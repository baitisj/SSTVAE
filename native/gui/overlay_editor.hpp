// Composing an overlay on the picture about to be sent.
//
// **The preview is `overlay::render()`'s output, not a Qt-drawn
// imitation of it.** That is the property the whole design rests on:
// what the operator arranges is what goes on the air, by construction
// rather than by two pieces of code agreeing. The reference says the
// same thing about its `QGraphicsView`; here it falls out even more
// directly, because a plain painted widget *has* no scene to drift.
//
// Selection handles come from `overlay::item_bbox`, which is the same
// geometry the renderer uses to place the item -- so a handle cannot
// sit somewhere other than the thing it selects.
//
// Coordinates in the document are normalized 0..1, and stay that way
// through dragging: the widget maps to canvas space and back, and never
// stores a pixel position. A saved template therefore means the same
// thing at any size.
