// Shared appearance: colours, secondary text, and the two widgets that
// existed in three copies each.
//
// This file is where things go that more than one panel has to agree
// about. Everything in it was previously either duplicated verbatim
// (`place_banner`, `to_pixmap`), kept in step by hand (the empty-canvas
// colours), or done three different ways in three files (dimmed text:
// a palette override in the settings dialog, `setEnabled(false)` on the
// receive card, bold in the log pane).
//
// **No stylesheets, here or anywhere.** Setting one on any widget makes
// Qt wrap the application style in `QStyleSheetStyle`, whose defaults
// are not the platform's -- most visibly, padding drops to zero, so
// every combo, spin box and line edit in the app gets its text jammed
// against the left border. One `color:` rule on one label did that to a
// whole window once. Everything here goes through `QPalette` or a
// painter.

//
// Reserved whether or not the note has one, so plain help and a

// in the margin beside the text rather than pushing it right. Measured

QLabel* note(const QString& text, QWidget* parent);

// The same treatment applied to a widget that already exists.
//
// The alternative in use was `setEnabled(false)`, which is an
// appearance change expressed as a state change: it also takes the
// widget out of the accessibility tree as interactive-but-unavailable,
// and it says "you cannot use this" about a label nobody was going to
// click.

// A long note as one line, with the rest behind a disclosure.
//
// The settings dialog had grown to where the Transmit tab was roughly
// 60% grey prose by area -- nine lines for one checkbox -- which is the
// point at which nobody reads any of it. `summary` is always visible;
// `detail` appears when the operator asks. Default collapsed, and the
// state is deliberately not persisted: it is a reading aid, not a
// setting.
//
// A factory rather than a class: the toggle is a lambda bound to the
// returned widget, so there is nothing for moc to do.

// A QLabel that shortens with an ellipsis instead of being cut off.
//
// Several labels carry `QSizePolicy::Ignored` horizontally so they
// cannot pin the window's minimum width -- which is right, and which
// means they are routinely handed less width than their text needs. A
// plain QLabel then *clips*, and the settings dialog's own scroll-area
// comment says why that is the wrong answer: "the operator cannot tell
// whether the text is cut off or simply ends". A callsign missing from
// the end of a status line reads as a callsign that was not decoded.
//
// **Elides in `paintEvent`, and does not override `setText`.**
// `QLabel::setText` is not virtual, so a subclass that shadows it is
// silently bypassed through a `QLabel*` -- and half of Qt holds labels
// that way. Eliding at paint time leaves `text()` returning the truth,
// needs no new API at the call sites, and cannot be routed around.

// --- pictures ----------------------------------------------------------------

// Paint a colour onto a button as its icon.
//
// A colour control has to *show* its colour; a button reading
// "Colour..." and nothing else shows none. Here rather than in a panel
// because the text palette has three of these wells (fill, gradient
// stop, stroke) and the transmit strip has a fourth, and the two
// details below are exactly the kind that get left out of a copy.
//
// **The guard.** Dragging a text item emits `selectionChanged` on every
// mouse move, so an unguarded rebuild -- parse, allocate, paint,
// `setIcon`, and the layout invalidation `setIcon` triggers -- runs at
// mouse-move rate on the app's most latency-sensitive path. The last
// colour is remembered on the button itself, as a dynamic property, so
// any number of wells are guarded without anyone holding state for
// them. An *unset* property and a property holding an invalid QColor
// are different, which matters: an invalid colour is a legal state (an
// image item has none), so "never painted" cannot be spelled as "the
// colour is invalid".
//
// **Give every such button its swatch at construction, before anything
// is selected.** A QPushButton grows when it is handed an icon --
// measured 80x22 without and 80x24 with -- so a button that acquires
// one on the first selection silently gets 2 px taller at that moment.
// On a platform where it is the tallest thing on its line of a wrapping
// row that is 4 px on the whole control strip, which the two panes are
// locked to: it cost a Windows-only CI failure. An invalid colour
// paints nothing, so the call is invisible and the metrics never move.

// SNR for display: "SNR 8.3 dB", or a placeholder when there is none.
//
// **Not `rx::fmt_snr`,** which the panels used to borrow. That one is
// the *CLI's* format and mirrors `sstvae/rx/engine.py` exactly, so it
// is not ours to change -- and it produces "8.3dB" with no space, has
// the English word "SNR" baked into a layer below the GUI where no
// translator can reach it, and returns an empty string for NaN. On
// screen an absent field is indistinguishable from a field that was
// never going to be there.

// --- layout ------------------------------------------------------------------

// Keep a floating error banner across the top of `target`.
//
// Floating rather than laid out: in the layout the banner displaced
// everything below it, so an error in one pane pushed that pane's
// picture down and the two stopped lining up -- precisely what the
// equal-panes work exists to prevent. This costs no layout at all.
//
// `heightForWidth`, not `sizeHint`: the message wraps, and a hint taken
// at unconstrained width is one line, which clipped a long device name
// to a sliver of its own text.
