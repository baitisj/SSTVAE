// Scheduled QRSS sends: a picture sent again and again on chosen quarter
// hours, while the app runs.
//
// An entry is one picture, one QRSS mode and one carrier, sent `count`
// times (0: until it is removed) starting at a quarter hour and then
// every `every_min` minutes -- 0 meaning back to back, the next send
// starting the half hour after the last pass of the one before. So
// "2 x A" is mode A, two sends, back to back (two passes, half an hour
// apart, both carrying part 1 of the picture), and "alternating hours"
// is every 120 minutes. Every send of an entry is the same picture in
// the same mode, so it has the same picture ID and receivers add the
// passes together.
//
// Back-to-back sends are handed to the transmitter as one run
// (`qrss_tx::Request::passes`), because the transmitter has about 2 s
// between one pass's audio and the next and a fresh send needs minutes
// to encode. Sends with a gap between them are separate runs, and the
// app goes back to receiving in the gap. Two entries may not overlap:
// the transmitter can send one thing at a time, and starting a send
// takes `START_LEAD_S`.
//
// The model (`Entry` and the free functions) is plain data and
// arithmetic, so `test_qrss_schedule.cpp` checks it on its own;
// `QrssScheduler` adds the file, the clock and the transmitter.
