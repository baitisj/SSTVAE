// The receive session, as QML sees it.
//
// **A view, owning nothing.** The session lives in `Session` and its
// lifetime is guaranteed by `ListenerService`; this class holds no ring
// buffer, no stream and no engine thread, and caches nothing they say.
// Every property is derived on demand, so an instance created after a
// reception started is in exactly the same position as one that was
// there all along -- which is what "the UI is a detachable view" has to
// mean in practice for it to survive a rotation or the screen going
// off.
//
// Starting and stopping go *through the service*, never straight to
// `Session`. That is the whole ownership inversion: if the UI could
// start a session directly, the session would belong to something
// Android may destroy mid-reception.
