// Deliberately *not* a port of the desktop's layout (docs/android.md,
// Andrew 2026-08-08): that layout history is a record of QtWidgets on a
// desktop, and reaching for it here would inherit answers to questions
// nobody is asking. A phone in portrait, held one-handed, with no rig
// panel to compete for space, wants a different arrangement -- so the
// waterfall gets real vertical extent as the tuning instrument it is,
// and the three areas are a bottom tab bar rather than a splitter.
ApplicationWindow {

    // Owns nothing: the rig session lives in `Session`, so keying
    // survives a rotation in the middle of an over.
    // **`rigControl`, not `rig`.** A `RigPane` declares `required
    // property var rig`, so inside its binding block the name `rig`
    // resolves to that property rather than to an outer id -- `rig: rig`
    // is a binding loop, not a hand-off. Naming the id differently is
    // what makes the two unambiguous.
    RigControl { id: rigControl }

    // **Back closes the picture viewer instead of the app.**
    //
    // Android delivers the back gesture (and the 3-button Back) as a
    // close request on the window, and nothing was refusing it — so
    // backing out of a full-screen reception ended the activity, which
    // is not what Back means when something is open on top. `Popup`'s
    // own `CloseOnEscape` does not cover this: that is Qt::Key_Escape,
    // and Android sends a close request, not an Escape.
    //
    // Declining the close is the whole fix for that case.
    //
    // **At the root, Back backgrounds the app rather than ending it,
    // whenever there is a session to protect.** Ending the activity ends
    // the *process*, and the process is what owns the engine — so the
    // single most ordinary gesture on a phone silently killed a
    // reception in progress and left the shade's promise that we were
    // listening untrue. Measured on API 36: the process died on SIGABRT
    // in Android's own HWUI teardown, which is a tombstone and would be
    // counted as a native crash, and the notification's last text froze
    // wherever the poller had left it.
    //
    // Backgrounding is what recorders, navigation and media apps do, and
    // it is what the ongoing notification already implies: the session
    // continues, the poller keeps the notification honest, and the task
    // stays in Recents so the launcher or the notification returns to
    // the screen that was left. Stopping is still one tap away — the
    // notification's own Stop action — which is where an operator
    // already looks for it.
    //
    // With nothing running there is nothing to protect, so Back leaves
    // the app exactly as Android users expect. Hijacking Back
    // unconditionally is the thing this deliberately does not do.
