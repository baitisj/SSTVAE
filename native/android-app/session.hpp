// The listening session, and the only thing that owns one.
//
// **This inverts the desktop's `AppState`** (docs/android.md). There,
// the window owns the engine and the engine dies with it, which is
// right for a machine whose app is either on screen or not running. A
// phone's listening session has to survive the screen going off, the
// activity being destroyed on rotation, and the app being swiped away,
// so ownership cannot sit anywhere the UI can take with it when it
// goes.
//
// So: the session is process-wide, `ListenerService` guarantees the
// process stays alive around it, and every UI is a *view* that attaches
// and detaches. Nothing outside here holds a ring buffer, a stream or
// an engine thread, and nothing outside here caches what they say --
// `progress()` is read on demand, so a view that was not attached when
// something happened is in exactly the same position as one that was.
//
// The corollary is the battery answer: with no view attached nothing
// renders at all, because there is nothing accumulating for a view to
// render later.
