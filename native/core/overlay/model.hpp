// The document only -- rendering lives with the editor in Phase 3. Two
// design choices carry over from `sstvae/overlay/model.py`, and both
// exist so that *templates* (saving an overlay and reapplying it to
// tomorrow's picture) stay a UI-only change rather than a redesign:
//
// **Coordinates are normalized** to 0..1 of the canvas and sizes are
// fractions of it, so a document is resolution-independent.
//
// **Image insets are late-bound references, not pasted bitmaps.**
// `ImageItem::source` is "last_rx" or a path, resolved at render time.
// A template saying "inset the most recent received picture, bottom
// left" therefore still means that next week -- which is the entire
// point, and impossible if the editor flattened the bitmap in at
// composition time.
